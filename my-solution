I handled this project in a very different way than it was rendered
previously the notifications bar was a button so i changed it to p tag 
so that when i flex it together with the image the background will not expand more
than the original padding it was given 


I nested the logo and the links in a div and did the same to the notification bar
and the image

when I looked at the solution there were some differences but the instruction was to get to 
at least do something similar to the project that was given
